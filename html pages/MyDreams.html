            On of my biggest dreams would be to own a subaru identical to the owned by colin Mcrae.
            This car symbolizes the passion, for a generation, of enthusiast that had respect for the road and their fellow drivers.
            Not only is the 1st gen Impreza the defintion for world rally, its also a badge given to few whom it deems worthy. Truly, 
            this car was, and still is, the best all round rally/economical vehicles EVER MADE in automotive history.
